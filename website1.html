            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                Online learning involves courses offered by postsecondary institutions that are 100% virtual, excluding
                massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is
                contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school building. It is the newest
                development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the spread of the internet and the
                World Wide Web. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also incorporate synchronous
                elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System for the administration
                of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning
                and pedagogy continue to transform as well.

                The term content knowledge refers to the body of knowledge and information that teachers teach and that
                students are expected to learn in a given subject or content area, such as English language arts,
                mathematics, science, or social studies. Content knowledge generally refers to the facts, concepts,
                theories, and principles that are taught and learned in specific academic courses, rather than to
                related skills—such as reading, writing, or researching—that students also learn in school.
